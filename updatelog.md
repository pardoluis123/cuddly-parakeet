 Other then theese updates I will update the enviornment tommorow, and clean up the ridiculously slow speed of the suggestions. Mostly this is an artifact of pandas is my assumption, as streamlit can only handle so much anyways numpy's contigous memory is probably useful for edge cases like this app. OK! all updates finished
 
 
 
 ## Updates as of 05-03-2025
 
 working code critic, 
 working music suggester, 
 working homescreen navigator,
 working dataframe import and incorporation,
 
 This all needs fine-tuning, but we finally have a proper "app," and I am now going to bed. I will upload the updated tests, and the assgn4 concept which is litteraly what our music thing does when it incorporates new music it just feels very unfeasible because of how the lag time manifests when sending calls back and forth with chatgpt at this point it truly easier to reduce using PCA and cluster using K-means but I will make a fake smaller dataset to use with openai()'s embedding techniques tommorow for incorporation of the class concepts.
 
 Basically to incorporate it im just merging the whole row of features and making it one big string and then using the openai() model to create embeddings
 
 I am also going to upload a .mov on the main page of the git showing how it works as of tonight while I upload a fresher version tommorow.
 
 Sorry for lack of structure in the upate :) very tired
